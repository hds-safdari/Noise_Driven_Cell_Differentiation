"Differentiation_organization": The main m.file which produces the main results, FIG.3, and movies. (MATLAB 2016)
The file path should be inserted in the lines:64,213,221, to execute the code. 


"shoving.biomass": JAVA code to evaluate Shoving step.

"gene_expression": MATLAB function to evaluate Gillespie algorithm. 
"clust_coeff" : MATLAB function to stimate clustering coefficient. 
"simple_spectral_partitioning": MATLAB function to stimate comminity size. 

To run the code, COMSOL 5.2 should be installed. The "COMSOL_Installation_Instructions.pdf" file gives the installation instructions. It requires a license file. The installation would take few minutes. 

The code will generate a figure which shows cell population.  

"Organization.jpg" ; a sample figure as the output of the code.
